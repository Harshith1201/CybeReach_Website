"India  Russia eye collaboration on nuclear energy, cybersecurity","Last Updated: May 24, 2025, 12:12:00 AM IST","India and Russia are strengthening ties. Discussions are underway for joint projects in nuclear energy and cybersecurity. Focus is on cutting-edge technology across sectors. A NITI Aayog team will attend a forum in Russia. They will explore science and technology cooperation. Small modular reactors are being considered. Collaboration extends to semiconductors, AI, and space technology.","TIL CreativesRepresentative ImageNew Delhi: As India readies to amend its contentious nuclear liability laws and boost its cyber defence mechanisms in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor, discussions are learnt to have been started with Russia to forge joint collaborations in nuclear energy and cyber space, besides cutting-edge technology across several sectors, ET has learnt.Deliberations are, in fact, picking pace ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putins India visit this year for the annual bilateral summit, to draw up clear roadmaps.Case in point: A high-level NITI Aayog team is expected to attend the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum next month where a special roundtable on Indo-Russia Science and Technology cooperation is lined up, ET has learnt. Movement is also being quietly made on the nuclear front with a clutch of small modular reactors SMRs being considered as part of the collaboration between the two countries. Russian nuclear firm Rosatom, which built the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant NPP, signed a memorandum of understanding this April with Maharashtra for thorium-based SMRs. It is gathered that Rosatom plans to build a number of SMRs and has been in talks with the stakeholders, according to people familiar with the matter. The company is also awaiting a green signal from India for another NPP, they said. There is keen interest to work with India on cybersecurity as well, especially co-development of cyber defence mechanisms, sector specific firewalls as well as cybersecurity products for global markets, it is gathered. Semiconductors, Artificial Intelligence, space technology and critical minerals are among other areas identified for cross-sectoral collaboration on knowledge creation and Brahmos-like co-development models in order to develop an enduring technology base for future products, according to people in the know. In fact, several steps have been taken over the last few months in this direction.Moscow-based non-governmental development organisation -Innopraktika -is readying to set up an Indo-Russian technology association and engineering centre with bases in both countries to spur innovation, it is learnt. Earlier this year, an Innopraktika delegation held discussions with the Indian business community to assess readiness for high-tech product development.Live EventsIn January, Russias leading National Research University - Higher School of Economics HSE and the University of Delhi, in partnership with Geoscan a portfolio company of the Innopraktika non-state development institute, inked an agreement to establish an international scientific mirror laboratory on data storage, processing and transmission in space systems. In November 2024, a Russian Business Center was set up in India to develop trade ties between the two countries, promote export cooperation and provide a platform for interaction between the business communities.Indias digital transformation is also moving in a direction very similar to that in Russia, with rapid growth in fintech, digital government services, e-commerce and smart city infrastructure, said Yury Maksimov, co-founder of Cyberus, a Russia-based international cybersecurity development foundation, adding that this kind of progress demands strong cybersecurity.India is not just a partner but a key player in shaping the future of global cybersecurity and digital architecture, Maksimov told ET.You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channelRead More News onIndia Russia collaborationnuclear energycybersecuritysmall modular reactorsspace technologydigital transformation IndiaRosatomInnopraktikaHigher School of EconomicsCatch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.

New e-Zero FIR: Govt launches pilot project for swift action against cybercrimes; how it can help you,"Last Updated: May 22, 2025, 05:08:00 PM IST","The initiative, which was launched as a pilot project in Delhi, will automatically convert eligible cybercrime complaints into FIRs and is currently applicable to financial frauds involving amounts exceeding Rs 10 lakh.","ET OnlineThe Government of India has recently launched e-Zero FIR, a new system designed to strengthen cybersecurity and expedite probes in high-value cyber financial crimes. The initiative, which was launched as a pilot project in Delhi, will automatically convert eligible cybercrime complaints into FIRs and is currently applicable to financial frauds involving amounts exceeding Rs 10 lakh. The government seeks to accelerate investigations and take swift action against cybercriminals through this new initiative.Is there a new government scheme offering earnings of Rs 10,000 per day? PIB clarifiesThe Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre I4C, a nodal agency established by the Ministry of Home Affairs MHA, has introduced the new e-Zero FIR initiative to nab any criminal with unprecedented speed, stated Amit Shah, Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation, on May 19, 2025, in a release by MHA.Launched as a pilot project for Delhi, the new system will automatically convert cyber financial crimes filed at NCRP or 1930 to FIRs, initially above the threshold limit of Rs 10 lakh. The new system, which will drive investigations swiftly cracking down on cybercriminals, will soon be extended to the entire nation. The Modi government is bolstering the cybersecurity grid to build a Cyber-Secure Bharat, Shah stated further.How the auto FIR process will work for high-value cyber fraud complaintsThe new mechanism will automatically convert complaints lodged through the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal NCRP and the Cybercrime Helpline 1930 into Zero FIRs, specifically for cases exceeding the Rs 10-lakh threshold. These FIRs will be filed electronically at the e-Crime Police Station in Delhi and subsequently transferred to the appropriate territorial cybercrime police stations.Live EventsSandesh G S, CTO, Bureau, says, When it comes to protecting customers from fraud, two things matter above all- speed and context. The I4Cs latest initiative addresses both. Weve seen that when victims report fraud within the golden hour, the likelihood of loss reduction improves by up to 23. Coupled with automatic FIR registration and routing to local cybercrime units, this drastically reduces procedural delays and enables faster action. But speed alone isnt enough. We cant see fraud as isolated events today; we know its a syndicated, structured operation. What appears to be a single case is often part of a broader network. Our experience at Bureau reflects this reality. Through our Graph Identity Network GIN, we tap into contextual intelligence that connects fraud attempts across identities, devices, and accounts, giving us invaluable intel into the end destination of money flows and uncovering associations with known fraudsters. Real-time reporting, combined with deep network visibility, can give us the clarity and speed needed to detect and dismantle fraud syndicates more effectively.Complainants will have a maximum of three days to visit the concerned police station and convert their Zero FIR into a regular FIR, thereby facilitating a more efficient legal process and faster resolution. While this auto-FIR initiative is currently being rolled out as a pilot in Delhi, the government plans to extend it to other states and Union Territories in the coming phases. The long-term vision is to build a cyber-secure Bharat. The e-Crime Police Station of Delhi has already been officially notified to handle the registration and routing of e-FIRs for specific cybercrime complaints submitted through the NCRP platform.
