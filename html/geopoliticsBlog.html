            <p><span id="quot">“War is always evident and evolving, just as its grounds of conflict”</span>
                Yes, you heard that heard that right! Nations have shifted their conflicts from air ,navy, ground to 'Cyber space' involving cyber scams, information theft and many more nation wide</p>
            <h2>Here are a few cases</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In May 2022, the US and the EU attributed attacks against commercial satellite communications networks which impacted fixed broad-bands and customers across Europe from one hour before the start of the Russia-Ukraine war on February 24, 2022—to Russia-sponsored attacks</li>
                <li>In the same year different attacks including targeted phishing attacks ,malware attacks ,massive Distributive Denial Of Service attacks from different countries targeting Ukraine's cyber physical systems like power houses , armories etc.</li>
                <li>Network Battalion 65, a hackers group related to the 'Anonymous' Group, has released a media update that it infiltrated the network of Roscosmos, the space agency of Russia, and tried to disrupt the operations of some satellites</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How is India dealing with it?</h2>
            <p>India was involved into many attacks by countries supposedly China and Pakistan </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Many notable attacks took place on India's infrastructure in light with the government's decision of abolishing the articles 370 and 35A leading to a cyber chaos caused by foreign groups but there remains a possibility on blaming it on Pakistan based criminals in collaboration with Turkish and Chinese cyber attackers </li>
                <li>Pakistan-based hackers conducted a major cyber-attack targeting India's power generation and transmission sector using the malware "ShadowPad”</li>
                <li>Private Indian hackers launched over a thousand cyberattacks on Pakistan's military</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In response to these newly emerging cyber warfare , has signed up many strategic agreements with United stater to improve their cooperation on cyber grounds</p>
            <p>Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) tracks and monitors cybersecurity incidents</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In 2016, India and the United States signed a cybersecurity agreement to enhance cooperation between the two countries</li>
                <li>In 2018, India and Japan signed a cybersecurity agreement to enhance cooperation in areas such as cyber defense, critical information infrastructure protection, and combating cybercrime</li>
                <li>In 2021, India and the United Kingdom signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance cooperation in cybersecurity and data protection</li>
                <li>In 2022, India and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance cooperation in cybersecurity and other areas of technology</li>
                <li>(how about we write it as a flowchart of incidents ?)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Things to consider :-</h2>
            <p>War is never ending , from areas to countries irrespective of the field .
                Cyber warfare has no geographic borders , suspicion is the only thing one can do . nations are hiring big brains to collapse infrastructures of other nations. 
                We need to be ready in this midst of chaos , even though governments are trying to safe keep their companies and citizens it is our duty keep our armors up .
                Stay informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and trends. This can help you identify potential risks and take appropriate measures to protect yourself
