Airports has increasingly become reliant on technology and the threat of cyberattacks will continue to grow.
                To stay ahead of this evolving threat, airports must invest in advanced cybersecurity measures, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to detect and prevent attacks before they occur.Preventing logic bomb attacks requires a multi-layered approach, including regular system audits, employee background checks, and implementing strict access controls.
                It is also important to have a response plan in place in case of an attack, including procedures for isolating infected systems and restoring data.</P>
            <h2>Mode of operation of a logical bomb is :</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Detecting sources of information and data.</li>
                <li>Deleting data in all sources </li>
                <li>Restricting user access</li>
                <li>Dormant Backdoors </li>
                <li>Corruption and stealing of data</li>
            </ul>
